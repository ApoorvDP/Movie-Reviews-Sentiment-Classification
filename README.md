# Movie Reviews - Sentiment Classification

A program which performs basic [sentiment classification](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sentiment_analysis) of movie reviews, labelling them as either positive or negative. The training and testing data set were from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/c/cs6998/data).

This entire initiative has been reformatted as a [jupyter notebook](https://jupyter.org), which contains all of the explanation, code/methods and results. The notebook can be downloaded, modified and run again if so desired.
